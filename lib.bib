abstract = {The price stabilization problem is stated and solved for a nonlinear cobweb model with government stocks. It is shown that if the storage capacity for the commodity is sufficiently large then there exists a simple stabilization policy, called the 'keep supply at equilibrium (KSE)' policy, such that the equilibrium price is a global attractor for the corresponding closed-loop system. In addition, it is shown that if the government approximates the equilibrium supply with the average supply, stabilization is guaranteed. We refer to this policy as 'keep supply at average (KSA)'. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{WRI12,
abstract = {In the long view, recent volatility of prices of the major grains is not anomalous. Wheat, rice, and maize are highly substitutable in the global market for calories, and when ag- gregate stocks decline to minimal feasible levels, prices become highly sensitive to small shocks, consistent with the economics of storage behavior. In this decade, stocks declined due to high global income growth and biofuels mandates, making markets unusually sensitive to subsequent unanticipated shocks, including biofuels demand boosts in reac- tion to high petroleum prices, the Australian drought, and other regional grain produc- tion problems. To protect their own vulnerable and politically influential consumers, key exporters restricted supplies in 2007, exacerbating the price rise. Understandably, vul- nerable importers are now building strategic reserves. To reduce costs and disincentive effects, reserves should have quantitative goals related to targeted distribution to the most vulnerable in severe emergencies. For countries with significant animal feeding or biofuels industries, options contracts to protect the consumption of the most vulnerable from harvest shocks are likely to be more cost-effective than emergency reserves.},

@article{SHA11,
abstract = {This paper reviews experiences on food export restrictions during 2007-10 and related studies and makes some proposals for disciplining export restrictions through the ongoing Doha Round negotiations. To start with, there is a strategic choice to be made. One option is to limit the disciplining to improving the requirements for notifications, information provision and consultations, along the line of the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture Article 12. This is the choice that has been made by negotiators, as reflected in the draft Doha texts of December 2008. In the mean time, the 2007-10 food crisis and price spikes have prompted calls from many quarters for going beyond that choice to actually disciplining restrictive policies such as export tax and ban. This is the second option in that strategic choice. For option 1, the paper discusses issues and ideas for strengthening Article 12. For option 2, it makes two concrete proposals, as alternatives. One is a Tax-Rate Quota scheme similar to the current Tariff-Rate Quota on imports. The other is a variable export tax scheme. Radical departure is very unlikely to be agreed and these schemes are seen as compromises and first steps. These ideas follow from the review of the use of export restrictive instruments during 2007-10, as well as studies. The second option will require de-linking the new Article 12 from GATT Article XI which permits almost full freedom for restricting food export. The fundamentals of the world food markets have changed and so multilateral trade rules also need to adjust accordingly.},

@article{BER13,
abstract = {A sharp escalation in worldwide commodity prices precipitated the global food crisis of 2007-2008, affecting the majority of the world's poor, causing protests in developing countries and presenting policymakers with the challenge of simultaneously addressing hunger, poverty, and political instability. These food price shocks fomented violent civil responses in some countries, but not others, offering a unique opportunity to assess the factors that contributed to these disturbances. We explore this question empirically with specific reference to Africa, where " food riots" occurred in at least 14 countries. By examining the socio-economic and political conditions facing African countries, we attempt to answer why only some countries in Africa witnessed food riots in late 2007 and early 2008, while others did not. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that higher levels of poverty (as proxied by the Human Poverty Index), restricted access to and availability of food, urbanization, a coastal location, more oppressive regimes and stronger civil societies are associated with a higher likelihood of riots occurring. We also examine three country cases (Egypt, Mozambique, Niger) which represent different circumstances and responses to the food crisis, and identify specific factors that were associated with food protests in each case. Our study highlights the importance of pro-poor policies and investments and improved governance in addressing the problems facing the poor and in helping secure political stability. As the frequency and variability of natural disasters increase in response to climate change, such policies can serve to protect the poor from the debilitating consequences of the resulting shocks. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This article reviews the potential impacts of climate change on food security. It is found that of the four main elements of food security, i.e., availability, stability, utilization, and access, only the first is routinely addressed in simulation studies. To this end, published results indicate that the impacts of climate change are significant, however, with a wide projected range (between 5 million and 170 million additional people at risk of hunger by 2080) strongly depending on assumed socio-economic development. The likely impacts of climate change on the other important dimensions of food security are discussed qualitatively, indicating the potential for further negative impacts beyond those currently assessed with models. Finally, strengths and weaknesses of current assessment studies are discussed, suggesting improvements and proposing avenues for new analyses.},

abstract = {Although the potential causes and consequences of recent rising international food prices have attracted widespread attention, many existing appraisals are superficial and/or piecemeal. This article attempts to provide a more comprehensive review of these issues based on the best and most recent research, as well as on fresh theoretical and empirical analysis. We first analyze the causes of the current crisis by considering how well standard explanations hold up against relevant economic theory and important stylized facts. Some explanations turn out to hold up much better than others, especially rising oil prices, the depreciation of the U.S. dollar, biofuels demand, and some commodity-specific explanations. We then provide an appraisal of the likely macro- and microeconomic impacts of the crisis on developing countries. We observe a large gap between macro and micro factors, which, when identifying the most vulnerable countries, often point in different directions. We conclude with a brief discussion of what ought to be learned from this crisis. Copyright (c) 2008 International Association of Agricultural Economists.},

abstract = {World market prices for major food commodities such as grains and vegetable oils have risen sharply to historic highs of more than 60 percent above levels just 2 years ago. Many factors have contributed to the runup in food commodity prices. Some factors reflect trends of slower growth in production and more rapid growth in demand that have contributed to a tightening of world balances of grains and oilseeds over the last decade. Recent factors that have further tightened world markets include increased global demand for biofuels feedstocks and adverse weather conditions in 2006 and 2007 in some major grain- and oilseed-producing areas. Other factors that have added to global food commodity price infl ation include the declining value of the U.S. dollar, rising energy prices, increasing agricultural costs of production, growing foreign exchange holdings by major food-importing countries, and policies adopted recently by some exporting and importing countries to mitigate their own food price infl ation. This report discusses these factors and illustrates how they have contributed to food commodity price increases.},

abstract = {Aggregate stocks of major grains declined to minimal feasible levels in 2007-2008, due to high global income growth and biofuel mandates. Given these minimal stocks, prices were very sensitive to shocks, such as the Australian drought, and biofuel demand boosts due to the oil price spike. The effects of these shocks were magnified by a sequence of trade restrictions by key exporters to protect vulnerable consumers. Beginning in the thin global rice market in the fall of 2007, these turned market anxiety into panic. Recognizing the unreliability of imports, vulnerable countries, including some in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), are now considering investing in strategic reserves, pursuing self sufficiency and acquiring foreign land to ensure grain supplies for domestic consumption. The associated expense and negative incentive effects on national reserves may be acceptable if they have quantitative targets related to the needs of the most vulnerable, for distribution only in emergencies. In many MENA countries, heavy subsidies on grain consumption for both rich and poor reduce the stabilizing response of consumption to price, and increase reserves needed to ensure food security. Accumulation of stocks is a more efficient strategy than pursuit of self-sufficiency in most MENA countries, as they have no comparative advantage in expanding agriculture, given restricted water supplies. Acquisition of foreign lands leaves food supplies exposed to sovereign risk and other supply chain problems beyond importers control. MENA countries could cooperate and so smooth much of the risk posed by fluctuations in their own harvests.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {The world food crisis in 2008 highlighted the susceptibility of the global food system to price shocks. Here we use annual staple food production and trade data from 1992?2009 to analyse the changing properties of the global food system. Over the 18 year study period, we show that the global food system is relatively homogeneous (85{\%} of countries have low or marginal food self-sufficiency) and increases in complexity, with the number of global wheat and rice trade connections doubling and trade flows increasing by 42 and 90{\%}, respectively. The increased connectivity and flows within these global trade networks suggest that the global food system is vulnerable to systemic disruptions, especially considering the tendency for exporting countries to switch to non-exporting states during times of food scarcity in the global markets. To test this hypothesis, we superimpose continental-scale disruptions on the wheat and rice trade networks. We find greater absolute reductions in global wheat and rice exports along with larger losses in network connectivity as the networks evolve due to disruptions in European wheat and Asian rice production. Importantly, our findings indicate that least developed countries suffer greater import losses in more connected networks through their increased dependence on imports for staple foods (due to these large-scale disturbances): mean (median) wheat losses as percentages of staple food supply are 8.9{\%} (3.8{\%}) for 1992?1996, increasing to 11{\%} (5.7{\%}) for 2005?2009. Over the same intervals, rice losses increase from 8.2{\%} (2.2{\%}) to 14{\%} (5.2{\%}). Our work indicates that policy efforts should focus on balancing the efficiency of international trade (and its associated specialization) with increased resilience of domestic production and global demand diversity.},

abstract = {The prices of some grain commodities more than doubled from March 2007 to March 2008. Increased food prices coincided with increasing global biofuel production, leading to speculation that biofuel production was responsible for the increased food prices. However, over the six-month period after March 2008, grain prices declined by 50{\%} while biofuel production continued to increase. It is not possible to reconcile claims that biofuel production was the major factor driving food price increases in 2007-2008 with the decrease in food prices and increase in biofuel production since mid-2008. The available data suggests that record grain prices in 2008 were not caused by increased biofuel production, but were actually the result of a speculative bubble related to high petroleum prices, a weak US dollar, and increased volatility due to commodity index fund investments. Many factors converged in 2007-2008 to increase food and related commodity prices including increased demand, decreased supply, and increased production costs driven by higher energy and fertilizer costs. Disentangling these factors and providing a precise quantification of their contributions is a difficult, perhaps impossible, task. In 2008, several reports were published by governmental and international agencies that speculated on the cause of increased food prices worldwide. Taken together, the available analyses suggest that biofuel production had a modest (3-30{\%}) contribution to the increase in commodity food prices observed up to mid-2008. The development of second-generation biofuels (e.g., cellulosic ethanol) which use non-food residual biomass or non-food crops should mitigate any future impact of biofuel production on food prices. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {With current annual production at over 600 million tonnes, wheat is the third largest crop in the world behind corn and rice, and an essential source of carbohydrates for millions of people. While wheat is grown over a wide range of environments, it is common in the major wheat-producing countries for grain filling to occur when soil moisture is declining and temperature is increasing. Average global temperatures have increased over the last decades and are predicted to continue rising, along with a greater frequency of extremely hot days. Such events have already been reported for major wheat growing regions in the world. However, the direct impact of past temperature variability and changes in averages and extremes on wheat production has not been quantified. Attributing changes in observed yields over recent decades to a single factor such as temperature is not possible due to the confounding effects of other factors. By using simulation modelling, we were able to separate the impact of temperature from other factors and show that the effect of temperature on wheat production has been underestimated. Surprisingly, observed variations in average growing-season temperatures of ±2 °C in the main wheat growing regions of Australia can cause reductions in grain production of up to 50{\%}. Most of this can be attributed to increased leaf senescence as a result of temperatures {\textgreater}34 °C. Temperature conditions during grain filling in the major wheat growing regions of the world are similar to the Australian conditions during grain filling. With average temperatures and the frequency of heat events projected to increase world-wide with global warming, yield reductions due to higher temperatures during the important grain-filling stage alone could substantially undermine future global food security. Adaptation strategies need to be considered now to prevent substantial yield losses in wheat from increasing future heat stress.},

abstract = {Recent increases in basic food prices are severely affecting vulnerable populations worldwide. Proposed causes such as shortages of grain due to adverse weather, increasing meat consumption in China and India, conversion of corn to ethanol in the United States, and investor speculation on commodity markets lead to widely differing implica-tions for policy. A lack of clarity about which factors are responsible reinforces policy inaction. Here, for the first time to our knowledge, we construct a dynamic model that quantitatively agrees with food prices. The results show that the dominant causes of price increases are investor speculation and ethanol conversion. Models that just treat supply and demand are not consistent with the actual price dynamics. The two sharp peaks in 2007/2008 and 2010/2011 are specifically due to investor speculation, whereas an underlying upward trend is due to increasing demand from ethanol conversion. The model includes investor trend following as well as shifting between commodities, equities, and bonds to take advantage of increased expected returns. Claims that speculators cannot influence grain prices are shown to be invalid by direct analysis of price-setting practices of granaries. Both causes of price increase, speculative investment and ethanol conversion, are promoted by recent regula-tory changes—deregulation of the commodity markets, and policies promoting the conversion of corn to ethanol. Rapid action is needed to reduce the impacts of the price increases on global hunger. behavioral economics | agricultural commodities | food prices | nonequilibrium markets | global crisis I n 2007 and early 2008 the prices of grain, including wheat, corn, and rice, rose by over 100{\%}, then fell back to prior levels by late 2008. A similar rapid increase occurred again in the fall of 2010. These dramatic price changes (1) have resulted in severe impacts on vulnerable populations worldwide and prompted analyses of their causes (2–57). Among the causes discussed are (i) weather, particularly droughts in Australia, (ii) increasing demand for meat in the developing world, especially in China and India, (iii) biofuels, especially corn ethanol in the United States and biodiesel in Europe, (iv) speculation by investors seeking financial gain on the commodities markets, (v) currency exchange rates, and (vi) linkage between oil and food prices. Many conceptual char-acterizations and qualitative discussions of the causes suggest that multiple factors are important. However, quantitative analysis is necessary to determine which factors are actually important. Al-though various efforts have been made, no analysis thus far has provided a direct description of the price dynamics. Here we provide a quantitative model of price dynamics demonstrating that only two factors are central: speculators and corn ethanol. We introduce and analyze a model of speculators describing bubbles and crashes. We further show that the increase in corn-to-ethanol conversion can account for the underlying price trends when we exclude speculative bubbles. A model combining both increasing ethanol conversion and speculators quantitatively matches food price dynamics. Our results imply that changes in regulations of commodity markets that eliminated restrictions on investments (58–62), and government support for ethanol production (63–66), have played a direct role in global food price increases. The analysis of food price changes immediately encounters one of the central controversies of economics: whether prices are controlled by actual supply and demand or are affected by speculators who can cause " artificial " bubbles and panics. Com-modity futures markets were developed to reduce uncertainty by enabling prebuying or selling at known contract prices. In recent years " index funds " that enable investors (speculators) to place bets on the increase of commodity prices across a range of com-modities were made possible by market deregulation (58). The question arises whether such investors, who do not receive delivery of the commodity, can affect market prices. One thread in the literature claims that speculators cannot affect prices (67, 68). Others affirm a role for speculators in prices (2–5, 11–17, 45–47, 59, 69, 70), but there has been no quantitative description of their effect. The rapid drop in prices in 2008, consistent with bubble/ crash dynamics, increased the conviction that speculation is play-ing an important role. Still, previous analyses have been limited by an inability to directly model the role of speculators. This limita-tion has also been present in historical studies of commodity pri-ces. For example, analysis of sharp commodity price increases in the 1970s (71) found that they could not be due to actual supply and demand. The discrepancy between actual prices and the expected price changes due to consumption and production was attributed to speculation, but no quantitative model was pro-vided for its effects. More recently, statistical (Granger) cau-sality tests were used to determine whether any part of the price increases in 2008 could be attributed to speculative activity (15, 72, 73). The results found statistical support for a causal effect,},

abstract = {The three major grain-producing countries of the former Soviet Union—Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan—have become a large grain-exporting region. During 2006-11, grain exports by the three countries together averaged 41 million metric tons a year, about 14 percent of the world total (including rice). According to USDA projections, by 2021 these three countries will provide 22 percent of the world's grain exports. Russia's wheat exports alone are projected to almost equal those of the United States, and total wheat exports by Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan will exceed those of the United States by 87 percent. However, growth of the livestock sector within these countries, aided by government policy, could mitigate these developments as expanding livestock herds reduce feed grain surpluses available for export. Further growth of the region's grain exports will also require improvement in the infrastructure for storing and transporting grain.},

abstract = {The objective of this study is to explore empirical evidence on the quantitative importance of supply, demand, and market shocks for price changes in international food commodity markets. To this end, it distinguishes between root, conditional, and internal drivers of price changes using three empirical models: (1) a price spike model where monthly food price returns (spikes) are estimated against oil prices, supply and demand shocks, and excessive speculative activity; (2) a volatility model where annualized monthly variability of food prices is estimated against the same set of variables plus a financial crises index; and (3) a trigger model that estimates extreme values of price spikes and volatility using quantile regressions. The results point to the increasing linkages among food, energy, and financial markets, which explain much of the observed food price spikes and volatility. While financial speculation amplifies short-term price spikes, oil price volatility intensifies medium-term price volatility. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

Government mandates are superior to consumption subsidies, especially with subopti- mal fuel taxes and the higher costs involved with raising tax revenues. But subsidies with mandates cause adverse interaction effects; oil consumption is subsidized instead. This unique result also applies to renewable electricity that faces similar policy combi- nations. Ethanol policy can have a significant impact on corn prices; if not, ineffi- ciency costs rise sharply. Ethanol policy can increase the inefficiency of farm subsidies and vice-versa. Policies that discriminate against trade, such as production subsidies and tariffs, can more than offset any benefits of a mandate.

Most of the long-term trends in agricultural produc- tion and consumption that contributed to the 2002-06 price increases and the 2007-08 price spike also contributed to the recent price surge, including global growth in popula- tion and per capita incomes, increasing world per capita consumption of animal products, rising energy prices and growing global biofuel production, depreciation of the U.S. dollar, and slower growth in agricultural productivity. The price spikes in both periods also refl ect short-term shocks from weather-related production shortfalls, a corresponding decline in world stocks of grains and oilseeds, and changes in trade policies and practices in some countries. Renewed economic growth and demand in low- and middle-income countries following the 2009 recession also played a role in recent price increases.
